## Introduction

For my project, I will be working on developing a simple blogging site called "Bloggle". The title comes from the play on words boggle, a word that means astonished, and the word blog. I got the idea from Reddit which is a play on the words read it. I will be using PHP with the Laravel framework since it is a really popular framework and because it allows for smooth development. For the database, I will be using SQL since I feel comfortable using it but it is also a very reliable database language. My site will have a login and register for my users. My users can post, edit or delete their blogs and they can comment or like/dislike another user's post. They can also follow other users, at which point they will have a separate tab where they can only see what the followed user posted

I aim to make my site responsive because it's important that it work well on any device, whether it's a phone or a computer. People like to browse in different ways, and I wanted to make sure that everyone can enjoy using it comfortably. I also decided on a dark color scheme for the site. The dark color scheme works well from a design perspective, but it also aims to reduce eyestrain on anybody using the site. Also, statistically looking at it, dark mode is used by 81.95% of users on apps and sites that allow for dark mode. The design of the site is clean and simple. In this case, I would use a rounded UI with transparent elements. I chose this look for its modern look and its friendly appearance. This is all important, because this way people of all ages could potentially use the site without getting confused by the UI.

With this site, I'm bringing together the essentials of what makes a blog site work today. It's about letting users post their thoughts, without any filters and having full control over them, while at the same time having the ability to see what other users on the site are up to and how they feel about what other users are doing. But more than that, it's about creating a space that's easy and enjoyable to use. This project lets me apply everything I've learned in web development, focusing on building something that's not just functional but also has applications in the real world and has the potential to be sold as either an internal blog tool or as a sponsored site such as Klix.ba in Bosnia
